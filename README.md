# Auto_painter_demo
The code for building a web demo of Auto_painter

## Introduction

This is the web demo code of [AutoPainter](https://github.com/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter). See the demo: https://youtu.be/g9rf-YFGgbg


There are three models, including a demo model trained on Minions, a model without color control, and a model with color control.


The sketch can be uploaded or generated by an uploaded RGB image, which means you can generate a cartoon portrait of yourself~

Enjoy this web demo. You can also build other GAN demo with the project.

## Requirements
python3.5

tensorflow1.4

tornado

werkzeug

flask

urllib

skimage

PIL

You can 'pip install' all the dependency based on Anaconda
## Quick start
1. Download three pre-train models from this link: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/ZEhW8CVc73IHC15
2. unzip it, and place it under the folder 'Auto_painter_demo', like

 - 'Auto_painter_demo/model1'
  - 'Auto_painter_demo/model2'
   - 'Auto_painter_demo/model3' 
3. RUN python app2.py

It will open a web demo at your localhost:5001. You can change this ip by modifying the code.
